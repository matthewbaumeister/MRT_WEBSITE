Entities are invited to submit a Part 1: Concept White Paper by 08:00 AM EST April 13, 2021.  The xTechWaveform Challenge incentivizes small businesses to propose innovative, viable technology concepts to the Army to develop an open hardware architecture for software defined radios (SDRs) that can facilitate the decoupling of hardware and software-based waveforms.  Each participant with a selected Concept White Paper will receive a $10,000 prize and be invited to participate in Part 2: Technology Pitches where participants will have an opportunity to present their technology concept to an Army panel.  Winners of the Part 2: Technology Pitches will each receive a $50,000 prize and will be invited to participate in Part 3, where they will have the opportunity to submit either a Phase I SBIR or a Direct to Phase II (D2PhII) SBIR proposal to prototype their proposed technology innovations.  Prize money will be awarded to selected participants through the Army xTech program and SBIR contract awards will be awarded through the Army SBIR program.\n\nThe prize competition, consisting of Part 1: Concept White Paper and Part 2: Technology Pitch, will be used to identify small business concerns that meet the criteria for award of a Phase I or D2PhII SBIR contract under 15 U.S.C. §638. Winners selected from Part 2: Technology Pitches will be the only firms eligible to participate in Part 3 and submit a Phase I or D2PhII SBIR proposal under this announcement.  A separate SBIR announcement will be issued concurrent with this prize competition announcement.\n\nThe efforts described in this Notice are being pursued under the authorities of 10 U.S.C. § 2374a, 10 U.S.C. § 2371b, and 15 U.S.C. § 638.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nThe xTechWaveform Challenge aims to accelerate integration of technology prototypes for crucial Army capability gaps into military platforms. Submissions will be open to technology solutions that can considerably improve Army terrestrial tactical radio communications by addressing the problem statement below.\n\nTopic: Waveform Challenge for Tactical Radios\nProblem Statement: The Army seeks a standardized, open architecture, non-proprietary SDR that may be configured to adapt to various waveforms, frequency bands, bandwidths, and modes of operation to support tactical, terrestrial communications requirements on the battlefield. Specifically, they aim to identify and source interoperable, platform agnostic solutions to encourage innovation and economies of scale. Current Army tactical SDRs exhibit proprietary hardware and software integration by a single vendor, which reduces potential waveform innovation and competitive pricing for future enhancements and upgrades.\n\nScience and Technology (S&T) intellectual property (IP) providers lack a clear entry point into the Army’s SDR value chain. The Army desires an open hardware architecture that can enable innovative S&T development activities to provide rapid demonstrations of new capabilities.  The SDR architecture shall support the integration of waveforms, software solutions, and updates.\n\n\nObjective: Develop a standardized, open hardware architecture (e.g., Software Communications Architecture (SCA), C4ISR Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS), and Modular Open RF Architecture (MORA)) that facilitates the decoupling of hardware and associated software-based waveforms, enabling of multi-vendor solutions, rapid integration of waveforms, and competitive pricing.	\n\nThe U.S. Army Program Executive Office Command Control Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) would like to invite interested entities to participate in the xTechWaveform Challenge.

RCCTO executes this mission consistent with the Army’s modernization priorities that maximize Soldiers’ capabilities to deploy, fight, and win on future battlefields. The U.S. Army faces an ever more lethal and disruptive battlefield requiring quick acquisition of innovative capabilities to prototype and deliver to the warfighter. xTechRCCTO AStRA is an opportunity for eligible businesses to pitch their novel technology solutions and prototypes directly to the U.S. Army.\n\nPurpose\nThe purpose of xTechRCCTO AStRA is to deliver an innovative approach and prototype to compete for an award to accelerate military technology and fill critical technology and operational gaps for the U.S. Army. This acquisition initiative will enable eligible organizations to respond with proposals that clearly articulate their prototype ideas and demonstrations and how they will satisfy the U.S. Army’s technology and operational gaps as identified in the Problem Statements below. A further goal is to incentivize industry participation by paying business innovators, at least partially, for some of their proposal preparation efforts and costs. RCCTO is focused on finding mature solutions that could provide combat prototype capability that can be in the hands of Warfighters within a one-to-three-year timeframe.  The expected period of performance (POP) for prototypes and demonstrations that address the Problem Statements is approximately 18 to 24 months.  RCCTO has a total budget of up to $25M of Budget Activity (BA) 6.5 funding (i.e., targeting System Development and Demonstration) for this acquisition; therefore, proposed solutions must deliver an expected outcome of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7+ in order to advise capabilities to Warfighters and be able to transition to a Program of Record. Based on the $25M funding limitation, RCCTO expects to award a series of 1 to 8 contracts or Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements, but may award more, less, or none based on funding and mission requirements.\n\nThis competition aims to drive business participation and promote entrepreneurship by awarding prize money for eligible companies or organizations to pitch their novel technology solutions and prototypes. This acquisition follows and complies with all applicable laws and federal/DOD acquisition regulations. Any awards under the AStRA program are considered “competitive” in accordance with (IAW) both 10 USC 127 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102 (d) ii.  To encourage commercial solutions, the acquisition process and awards will also follow the guidance of Class Deviation 2018-O0016 under the auspices of Public Law (PL) 114-329, Section 879 of the 2017 NDAA.  Prize monies are authorized and will be “merit-based” and paid IAW 10 USC 2374a (Prizes for Advanced Technology Achievements) and 10 U.S.C. § 2371b (Prototype Projects).\n\nProblem Statements\nxTechRCCTO AStRA aims to accelerate integration of technology prototypes for crucial Army capability gaps and specific problems into military platforms and will target mature programs/projects with exit TRL of 7+. Submissions will be open to technology solutions that can clearly articulate how the proposal/prototype addresses and solves one of the problem statements outlined below:\n\nPEO IEW&S Problem Statements\n\nTopic 1: Multifunction Antenna for Medium Altitude Air Platform\n\nProblem Statement: As the Army modernizes to meet Large Scale Combat Operations (LSCO) and Multi-Domain Operations (MDO), it needs its aerial sensors to do more with less. Multifunction antennas are not a new concept, but with recent technological advances, the Army believes there may be commercial solutions available to expand current capabilities. The Army is looking for a millimeter-wave multifunction RF system to find, fix, and track moving targets using low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf or mature technology on a Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constrained platform. The frequency goal is 18-50 GHz while maximizing the number of concurrent operating modes. Primary modes include Air/Ground Moving Target Indication (AMTI/GMTI) radar, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging, Electronic Support/Attack (ES/EA), and ship-to-ship communications. Secondary modes include terrain following and reach-back communications. The design needs to consider both ground and airborne targets.	\n\nThe U.S. Army would like to invite interested business entities and academic institutions to participate in the xTech Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) Army Strategic Rapid Acquisition (AStRA) competition (RCCTO Innovation Day 3) being conducted between April and July 2021. xTechRCCTO AStRA aims to engage with eligible large and small U.S.-based companies and organizations and will provide a forum to collaborate with the Army, earn prize money, and provide potential f	\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Army would like to invite interested business entities and academic institutions to participate in the xTech Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) Army Strategic Rapid Acquisition (AStRA) competition (RCCTO Innovation Day 3) being conducted between April and July 2021. xTechRCCTO AStRA aims to engage with eligible large and small U.S.-based companies and organizations and will provide a forum to collaborate with the Army, earn prize money, and provide potential funding opportunities to tackle Army technology gaps for both Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Intelligence Electronic Warfare & Sensors (PEO IEW&S) and PEO Soldier RCCTO.\nThe U.S. Army’s RCCTO has partnered with Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) to deliver this competition to quickly target, acquire, demonstrate, test, and ultimately field promising new technology. xTechRCCTO AStRA will provide an opportunity for both traditional	\N	\N	{"Artificial Intelligence",Ai,"Machine Learning",Ml,Autonomous}	\N	{"Artificial Intelligence",Ai,"Machine Learning",Ml,Autonomous,Robotics,Cyber,Electronics,Sensors,Communications,Energy,Power,Battery,Materials,Manufacturing,"Additive Manufacturing",Wearables,Navigation,Gps,Timing,Cloud,Radar,Unmanned,Drone}	{"Six Challenge Topics based on Army Strategic Rapid Acquisition"}	\N	Only U.S.-based companies or organizations are considered eligible to participate in this effort.

The impact of long distances can affect overall strategy, tactics, and logistics. Even with unrivaled capabilities, the ability to collect and understand intelligence can decay over distance. The supply chain is also heavily impacted, as distance increases, the time to provide supplies increases, supply routes can be contested, and even when supplies arrive safely, upkeep and maintenance are still a concern. These are just a few of the ways that distance impacts the effectiveness of our military overseas.\n\nThe U.S. Army is interested in enabling technologies that could help overcome the “tyranny of distance”. Examples of technologies that address this issue include but are not limited to the following domains:\n\nLogistics/Supply Chain: To ensure rapid resupply of material and aid.\nSustainment and Climate: To limit the need for resupply across geographically dispersed troops.\nCommunications: To ensure secured communication in degraded environments over extraordinary distances.\nInternet of Things (IoT)/Sensing: To increase force control and introduce autonomous capabilities in Theater.\nInformation Advantage: To increase real-time situational awareness through information operations and a commons intelligence picture.\n\nThese examples have been identified by U.S. Army experts as being challenge areas of interest, but submissions are not limited to the list of provided domains.	\n\nThe U.S. Army would like to invite interested entities to participate in the xTechPacific competition, a forum for eligible small businesses in the U.S. Pacific region to engage with the Army, earn prize money, participate in the accelerator program, and the opportunity to submit a proposal for a Phase I SBIR or Direct to Phase II award. xTechPacific offers an opportunity for eligible participants to pitch novel technology solutions directly to the Army addressing tyranny of distance challenge	\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Army would like to invite interested entities to participate in the xTechPacific competition, a forum for eligible small businesses in the U.S. Pacific region to engage with the Army, earn prize money, participate in the accelerator program, and the opportunity to submit a proposal for a Phase I SBIR or Direct to Phase II award. xTechPacific offers an opportunity for eligible participants to pitch novel technology solutions directly to the Army addressing tyranny of distance challenges faced by the U.S. Pacific region.\nThe U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM)-Pacific, U.S. Army Pacific (USAPAC), and Hawaii Technology Development Corporation (HTDC) in partnership with the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)), recognizes that the Army must enhance engagements with eligible small businesses by: (1) understanding the spectrum of ‘world-class’ technologies being developed commercially that may bene	\N	\N	{"Artificial Intelligence",Ai,"Machine Learning",Ml,Autonomous}	\N	{"Artificial Intelligence",Ai,"Machine Learning",Ml,Autonomous,Cyber,Electronics,Sensors,Communications,Networking,Energy,Power,Materials,Manufacturing,"Additive Manufacturing",Wearables,Navigation,Gps,Timing,Cloud,Iot,"Internet Of Things",Radar,Unmanned,Drone}	{"Logistics/Supply Chain; Sustainment and Climate; Communications; Internet of Things (IoT)/Sensing; Information Advantage"}	\N	The xTechPacific competition is voluntary and open to U.S.-based sole proprietors and small businesses within Alaska, Hawaii or Washington.\nThe U.S.-based entities allowed to participate in this competition include:\nSole proprietors (someone who owns an unincorporated business by themselves);\nSmall businesses in accordance with Small Business Administration guidance under 13 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 121.201; or\nAny entity willing and able to be registered as a small business, meeting the requirements of 13 CFR §121.201, if selected to participate in this competition.\nEach eligible entity:\nShall be incorporated in, and maintain, a primary place of business in Alaska, Hawaii, or Washington;\nMust be less than 500 employees and at least 50% owned or operated by U.S. citizens or permanent residents;\nMay not be a federal entity or employ a federal employee acting within the scope of their employment; and\nIs required to register in System for Award Management (SAM) and have or obtain an active CAGE code and DUNS number.

The Army recognizes that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) must enhance engagements with eligible businesses by (1) understanding the spectrum of ‘world-class’ technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the DOD, (2) integrating the sector of commercial innovators into the DOD Science and Technology (S&T) ecosystems, and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the DOD.\n\nProblem Statements\n\nTopic 1: Position Tracking on Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS)\n\nChallenge: The U.S. Army is looking for a modular, lightweight, high fidelity position tracking capability to record the location and orientation of small unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The position tracking solution must provide accuracy on the order of centimeters and must not rely on differential Global Positioning Systems (dGPS). Absolute position is not required, rather relative position can be expressed in local coordinates. The position tracking solution may be supplemented using existing capabilities of the host platform, and drift in position data must be defined, computed, and minimized to the extent possible.  The use of low-SWaP (size, weight, and power) components is ideal.  Tracking solutions may or may not be low-SWaP at this time but a clear path must be defined for achieving SWaP constraints.\n\nTopic 2: Low-Cost Millimeter Wave Imager\n\nChallenge: Millimeter wave imaging is often used as a tool for detecting potential threats such as improvised explosive devices. Current millimeter wave imaging solutions are too large and expensive for wide-spread use. Therefore, the U.S. Army is looking for millimeter wave imagers that could be developed at a lower cost and with a smaller form factor than the leading commercially available systems.\n\nTopic 3: Autonomous Sensor Orchestration\n\nChallenge: The U.S. Army is looking to develop an intelligent system where Counter Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) sensors and systems can orchestrate autonomously to communicate and coordinate their actions. The goal of this system is to reduce latency and bandwidth while improving reliability and increasing safety. The U.S. Army is interested in novel or improved software frameworks which can automate some or all of the following tasks: process sensor data and terrain maps to recommend optimal configurations and locations for sensors, identify likely dead zones of coverage, choose and cue other available sensors based on explosive detections, and suggest potential countermeasures for the convoy or other assets to be protected during C-IED missions.	\n\nThe U.S. Army would like to invite interested entities to participate in the xTechDetect competition. xTechDetect is a forum to engage with the Army, earn prize money and provide potential funding opportunities to tackle Army challenges within the counter-improvised explosive device (C-IED) space.\n\nThe U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM), the DEVCOM Forward Elements (DFE Americas, Atlantic, Pacific) and the U.S. Office of Naval Research Global (ONR-G) have partnered with	\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Army would like to invite interested entities to participate in the xTechDetect competition. xTechDetect is a forum to engage with the Army, earn prize money and provide potential funding opportunities to tackle Army challenges within the counter-improvised explosive device (C-IED) space.\nThe U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM), the DEVCOM Forward Elements (DFE Americas, Atlantic, Pacific) and the U.S. Office of Naval Research Global (ONR-G) have partnered with the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) to deliver the xTechDetect competition.

The competition will provide operationally-relevant and technical feedback from Army experts on proposed ideas submitted to this competition and offer cash prizes to selected finalists, along with direct exposure to key stakeholders, and the opportunity to test out their products in tactically relevant environments.\n\nThe U.S. Army’s PM MC is working on developing and refining a CMFF reference Architecture (RA) that provides industry with constraints to assist them in focusing their Internal Research and Development (IRAD) spending to meet Army needs. Some of the biggest challenges currently anticipated for existing CMOSS Participants are heat dissipation in tactically relevant vehicles’ environments, vibration and shock profiles of those vehicles, and vehicular Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWAP-C) constraints that currently exist in the vehicles. This competition is focused on providing Army input on current products to industry partners for improving their products, so they are prepared for a planned FY24 OTA Contract release.\n\nThe competition will consist of two-rounds: (1) a short concept white paper and (2) a technology pitch / test event at the PIF in Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Based on the white papers received, up to four (4) finalists will be selected and receive an invitation to participate in the technology pitch / test event. Up to four (4) winners will be selected from the pitch event and awarded a prize of $25,000 each. Details on the prize structure are listed in this announcement. In addition to cash prizes, participants will have the opportunity to engage with U.S. DOD stakeholders through information sharing and networking opportunities and receive a written test report from the PIF on their product performance in its intended environment.\n\nThe efforts described in this notice are being pursued under the authorities of 10 United States Code (USC) §4025. While the authority of this program is 10 USC §4025, a concept white paper submitted to the xTechCMFF Integration Fest may generate interest by another DOD organization for a funding opportunity outside of this program (e.g., submission of a proposal under a Broad Agency Announcement). The interested DOD organization may contact the participant to provide additional information or ask for a request for proposal in a separate solicitation.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nMounted ground and air platforms are full of radios, computers, video displays, sensors, electronic warfare tools, antennas and other vital communication technologies –each with its own power draw, space claim, and proprietary design. The Army has defined a suite of open architecture industry and Army standards to enable the reduction of C5ISR system size, weight and power – cooling (SWaP-C). These standards will also serve to ensure commonality across multiple platforms by enabling the standardization and sharing of hardware and software components.	\n\nProgram Manager Mission Command (PM MC), the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance/Electronic Warfare (DEVCOM C5ISR/EW), C5ISR Prototype Integration Facility, (PIF), Product Manager (PM) Interoperability Integration and Services (PM I2S), PM Tactical Radios (TR), PM Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C5ISR MOSA Management Office (MMO), Program Executive Office (PEO) C3T, PE	\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nProgram Manager Mission Command (PM MC), the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance/Electronic Warfare (DEVCOM C5ISR/EW), C5ISR Prototype Integration Facility, (PIF), Product Manager (PM) Interoperability Integration and Services (PM I2S), PM Tactical Radios (TR), PM Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C5ISR MOSA Management Office (MMO), Program Executive Office (PEO) C3T, PEO Aviation, PEO Ground Combat Systems (GCS), and the Network Cross Function Team have partnered with the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) to deliver the xTechCMFF Integration Fest.\nThe Army recognizes that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) must enhance engagements with eligible businesses by (1) understanding the spectrum of ‘world-class’ technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the DOD, (2) integrating the sec	\N	\N	{"Artificial Intelligence",Ai,"Machine Learning",Ml,Cyber}	\N	{"Artificial Intelligence",Ai,"Machine Learning",Ml,Cyber,Electronics,Sensors,Communications,Networking,Energy,Power,Materials,Manufacturing,"Additive Manufacturing",Wearables,Navigation,Gps,Timing,Cloud,Unmanned,Drone}	{"CMFF Aligned Systems"}	\N	Eligible entities include large and small U.S. If selected, participating entities must have or be able to obtain a CAGE code prior to advancing in the second stage of the competition.
